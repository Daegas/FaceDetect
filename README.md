# FaceDetect
The code is based in:
# Face detection demo using MTCNN and OpenCV
# Author: Juan-Pablo Ramirez-Paredes <jpi.ramirez@ugto.mx>
# Course: Artificial Intelligence
# University of Guanajuato
and

#
# This small demonstration needs Tensorflow 1.14, Keras, OpenCV 4 and MTCNN
# A quick way to install these on Win10 and Anaconda (as admin):
# conda create -n facerec pip python=3.7
# conda activate facerec
# pip install tensorflow==1.14 opencv-contrib-python==4.1.0.25
# pip install keras
# pip install mtcnn
#pip install Pillow
#pip install matplotlib
#pip install sklearn

#The facenet model is available here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12aMYASGCKvDdkygSv1yQq8ns03AStDO_
